# Searching_problems

### 1. Linear_Search 

##### Library Inclusion and Namespace

The program begins by including a library necessary for input and output operations. This allows the program to display output on the screen.
It also specifies that we can use standard functions and objects (like those for input and output) without having to use a specific prefix.

##### Search Function

1. There is a function designed to search for a specific element within an array of numbers.
2. This function takes three parameters:
        An array of numbers.
        The total number of elements in the array.
        The specific number we are looking for.
3. The function looks through each element in the array one by one:
4. If it finds the element we are looking for, it returns the position (index) of that element within the array.
5. If it finishes checking all elements without finding the desired one, it returns a value indicating the element is not present.

##### Main Function

1. In the main part of the program, an array of numbers is defined.
2. A specific number to search for within this array is also defined.
3. The program calculates how many elements are in the array.
4. It then calls the search function with the array, the number of elements, and the specific number to find.
5. Based on the result returned by the search function, the program displays a message indicating whether the element was found and, if so, its position in the array.
